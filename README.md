# Super Tetrominoes

A player-vs-player falling-blocks game where clearing multiple rows is bad luck for your opponent.

Play it now on ~http://play.super-tetrominoes.online~ (The server has been taken down unfortunately).

Or play it on one screen using the WASD and arrow keys for each player.

## Installation

No installation required! It is built as a standalone application. Simply unzip the file and run.
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/LukazNel/Super-Tetrominoes/releases).

Note: Windows might complain about the application being potentially harmful. This is only because the code is not signed, but it is very much safe to run.

## Building

his program is built and tested with Qt 5.15 for Windows 10 64-bit. Previous Qt versions and other desktop platforms are untested, but should work. Simply import the project into Qt Creator and build.
